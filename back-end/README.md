# 📚 BACK-END VIVLIO-STORE

This project is using Express.js, Sequelize, and MySQL to manage book data.

## 🚀 Features

- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for books.
- Uses Sequelize as ORM.
- Uses `.env` for flexible database configuration across different environments.

---

## 🛠 Installation

### 1️⃣ **Clone the Repository**

```sh
git clone <repository_url>
cd book-store-api
```

### 2️⃣ **Install Dependencies**

```sh
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ **Create a `.env` File**

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following database configuration:

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_NAME=book_store
DB_PORT=3306
```

> **Ensure** MySQL is running and the `book_store` database is created!

### 4️⃣ **Run Migrations & Seeders (Optional)**

If you want to populate the database with sample data:

```sh
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
```

### 5️⃣ **Start the Server**

```sh
npm start
```

The server will run at `http://localhost:3000`

## 📌 API Endpoints (On progress)

| Method | Endpoint | Description        |
| ------ | -------- | ------------------ |
| GET    | `/books` | Retrieve all books |

# 📘 Sequelize Guide

This document provides an overview of Sequelize, how it is used in this project, and step-by-step instructions to manage the database using Sequelize.

---

## 🔹 What is Sequelize?

Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MSSQL. It simplifies database interactions by allowing developers to work with JavaScript objects instead of raw SQL queries.

---

## 📌 How Sequelize is Used in This Project

- **Database Connection:** Sequelize handles the connection to MySQL defined in the `.env` file instead of `config/config.json`.
- **Models:** Data structure definitions are stored in the `models/` directory.
- **Migrations & Seeders:** The `migrations/` directory contains database schema changes, and `seeders/` populate initial data.

---

## ❗ Note on `config/config.json`

In this project, we do **not** use `config/config.json` for database configuration. Instead, we use environment variables (`.env`) for better flexibility and security. Ensure you have a `.env` file with the necessary database configurations.

Example `.env` file:

```
DB_HOST= . . .
DB_USER= . . .
DB_PASSWORD= . . .
DB_NAME= . . .
DB_PORT= . . .
```

This setup allows each developer to use their own local database configuration without modifying project files.

---

## 🛠 Setting Up Sequelize

### 1️⃣ Install Sequelize and Dependencies

```sh
npm install sequelize sequelize-cli mysql2
```

### 2️⃣ Initialize Sequelize

Run the following command to set up Sequelize in the project:

```sh
npx sequelize-cli init
```

This will create the following structure:

```
📂 config       # Database configuration
📂 models       # Sequelize models
📂 migrations   # Database migration files
📂 seeders      # Data seeding files
```

### 3️⃣ Configure Database

Edit `config/config.json` to define your database connection:

```json
{
  "development": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": "",
    "database": "book_store",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  }
}
```

> **However, this file is not used in this project. Use `.env` instead.**

### 4️⃣ Create a Model

Example: Creating a `Book` model:

```sh
npx sequelize-cli model:generate --name Book --attributes title:string,author:string,price:decimal
```

This generates:

- A model file in `models/book.js`
- A migration file in `migrations/`

### 5️⃣ Run Migrations

To apply migrations and create tables in the database:

```sh
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

### 6️⃣ Create a Seeder

To insert initial data into the database:

```sh
npx sequelize-cli seed:generate --name demo-books
```

Then edit the generated file in `seeders/` to add data.
Run the seeder with:

```sh
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
```

## 🔄 Running Sequelize Commands

| Command                                 | Description             |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `npx sequelize-cli db:migrate`          | Apply migrations        |
| `npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo:all` | Rollback last migration |
| `npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all`         | Run all seeders         |
| `npx sequelize-cli db:seed:undo:all`    | Undo all seeders        |

---

npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all

npx sequelize-cli db:seed:undo:all
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo:all

## ✅ Best Practices

- Keep models and migrations updated.
- Use environment variables instead of hardcoded database credentials.
- Regularly backup your database before running migrations.
